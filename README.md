## Important Notes

- This community-maintained package isn't affiliated with [FOSSBilling](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling). Please report issues here rather than on the [FOSSBilling](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling) repo.
- Reseller support in the API is limited.  It does support creating Reseller accounts, though the API doesn't seem to provide a way to get all the domains/users hosted by the Reseller to suspend/un-suspend them. I'm not really sure if this happens if the reseller's website get suspended. 
- For questions, concerns, or issues with this server manager, please open an issue on GitHub.
- If [FOSSBilling](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling) updates and breaks this server manager, report the issue here, and I'll update it to work with the latest version.
